# Configure Simply

A React single-page application built with Vite, TypeScript, shadcn/ui, and Tailwind CSS.
The production image is served by Nginx and published to the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR).

## Getting Started

Prerequisites: Node.js 20+ and npm.

```sh
npm ci          # install dependencies
npm run dev     # start the dev server
```

Other useful scripts:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run build` | Production build |
| `npm run build:dev` | Development build |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint |
| `npm test` | Run tests with Vitest |
| `npm run test:coverage` | Run tests with coverage |

## Branch Protection

The `main` branch is protected. Direct pushes are not allowed -- all changes must go through a pull request. The **Code Quality** workflow is a required status check that must pass before a PR can be merged.

## CI/CD Workflows

All workflows run on GitHub Actions and use GitHub-native services (GHCR for container images, `GITHUB_TOKEN` for authentication). Workflow files live in `.github/workflows/`.

### 1. Code Quality (`code-quality.yml`)

**Trigger:** pull requests targeting `main`.

Runs static analysis as a merge gate to catch issues before they reach production:

- **ESLint** -- enforces code style and catches common JavaScript/TypeScript mistakes.
- **TypeScript type check** (`tsc --noEmit`) -- validates type correctness across the codebase without emitting build output.

This is a required status check -- PRs cannot be merged until it passes.

### 2. Build and Push Docker Image (`docker-push.yml`)

**Trigger:** when a pull request is merged into `main` (via the resulting push event).

Builds a production Docker image and publishes it to GHCR:

1. Checks out the repository.
2. Authenticates with `ghcr.io` using the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
3. Builds the multi-stage Docker image (Node 20 build stage, Nginx production stage).
4. Pushes the image as `ghcr.io/<owner>/<repo>:latest`.

The workflow requires `packages: write` permission to push to the container registry.

### 3. Smoke Test (`smoke-test.yml`)

**Trigger:** automatically runs after the *Build and Push Docker Image* workflow completes successfully on `main`.

Validates that the newly published container image actually works:

1. Pulls the `latest` image from GHCR.
2. Starts the container on port 8080.
3. **HTTP health check** -- verifies the app responds with HTTP 200.
4. **Security headers check** -- confirms the Nginx configuration includes required headers:
   - `X-Content-Type-Options`
   - `X-Frame-Options`
   - `X-XSS-Protection`
   - `Referrer-Policy`
5. Tears down the container (runs even if earlier steps fail).

### Workflow Pipeline

```
pull request → Code Quality (lint + type check)  ← must pass to merge
      │
      ▼ merge
push to main → Build and Push Docker Image → Smoke Test
```

Code Quality runs on every PR as a required check.
Build and Push runs only after a PR is merged into `main`.
The Smoke Test is chained to the Build workflow via `workflow_run` and only executes when the build succeeds.

## Docker

The `Dockerfile` uses a two-stage build:

| Stage | Base Image | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **build** | `node:20-alpine` | Install dependencies and run `vite build` |
| **production** | `nginx:alpine` | Serve the static assets with custom `nginx.conf` |

Build and run locally:

```sh
docker build -t config-simply .
docker run -p 8080:80 config-simply
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.
